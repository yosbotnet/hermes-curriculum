"""Config-driven build orchestration: run the whole corpus flow from a manifest.

This module is the reproducible replacement for the ad-hoc ``scripts/`` one-offs
(``ingest_corpus.py`` + ``gen_questions.py``): instead of hardcoded file lists,
absolute bundle paths, and a key scraped out of one user's ``~/.hermes`` config,
every collaborator is constructed from a :class:`curriculum.config.Settings` and
every input comes from a declarative *manifest* dict. That makes the build
agent-bootstrappable -- point a manifest at any plain-text course materials, hand
in a Settings, and the same code path produces the graph, links the isolated
concepts, and generates questions.

Why the heavy imports are deferred
----------------------------------
The Postgres adapter (``psycopg``/``pgvector``) and the embedding linker are
optional, environment-specific dependencies. They are imported *inside* the
functions that need them, never at module load, so ``import curriculum.app.build``
succeeds on a machine with no database driver and no network -- which is exactly
what lets the manifest loader (pure JSON + validation) be unit-tested offline and
lets the rest of the test-suite import this module freely. The OpenAI-compatible
providers and the ingestion passes, by contrast, are stdlib-only and safe to
import eagerly.

Standard library plus the project's own modules only.
