"""Multipass ingestion: the working context plus the individual passes.

The ingestion pipeline is a Chain of Responsibility (see ``pipeline.py``): a
fixed, ordered sequence of small passes, each of which reads and mutates a
single shared :class:`IngestionContext`. Splitting extraction, dedup, edge
inference, question generation and verification into separate passes keeps each
one to a single responsibility and lets the pipeline be reordered or extended
(Open/Closed) without touching the others.

Determinism and cost
---------------------
Every pass takes its collaborators (an :class:`LlmProvider`, an
:class:`EmbeddingProvider`) by injection, so the same context plus the same
fakes always yields the same result -- no module-level randomness, no wall
clock, no network. In tests the collaborators are the deterministic
:class:`curriculum.providers_fake.FakeLlm`/``FakeEmbedder``; in a real run they
are the Nous-backed adapters (the only place paid inference happens).

Grounding (anti-fabrication)
----------------------------
The whole graph is built from source chunks that carry a ``file``/``line``
provenance. The passes pass that provenance through faithfully -- in
particular :class:`ExtractPass` never invents a citation; if the model fails to
cite a source the candidate is left ungrounded on purpose, so the adversarial
:class:`VerifyPass` can drop it. Nothing reaches persistence that cannot be
traced to a source file present in the ingest input.

Standard library only (``json``/``re``/``math``/``dataclasses``), per the
core-module constraint.
