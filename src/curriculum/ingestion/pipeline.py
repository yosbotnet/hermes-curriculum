"""The ingestion pipeline: an ordered Chain of Responsibility plus persistence.

A :class:`Pipeline` is just an ordered sequence of :class:`IngestionPass`
objects and the glue that runs them against a shared
:class:`IngestionContext`, then writes the verified results out through the
repository ports. Keeping "run the passes" and "persist the result" as two
separate steps lets a caller inspect (or dry-run) the working set before
committing anything to storage.

The composition is dependency-injected end to end: passes receive their
providers, ``persist`` receives its repositories. Nothing here knows about a
concrete adapter, so the whole pipeline is exercised in tests with the
deterministic ``FakeLlm``/``FakeEmbedder`` and the in-memory repositories. A
real run swaps in the OpenAI-compatible providers and the Postgres/OKF repositories
-- the only place paid inference and durable writes happen -- without any
change to this module.
